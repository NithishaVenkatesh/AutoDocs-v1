# Chapter 6: Stitching Status Check

In the [previous chapter](05_image_set_processing_loop.md), we built a powerful engine using loops to automatically process every folder of images. Inside that loop, we call the `stitcher.stitch()` command to do the magic. But what happens after we press the "magic button"?

Stitching photos is a complex art. Sometimes, it just doesn't work. Maybe the photos don't overlap enough, or the lighting is too different. Our program needs to be smart enough to know whether the magic worked or failed. This chapter is all about how we check the result and make a decision.

## The Problem: Was it a Success or a Failure?

When we ask the stitcher to do its job, we're hoping for a beautiful panorama. But there's no guarantee.

```python
# We ask the stitcher to combine our images
(status, result) = stitcher.stitch(images)
```

This line returns two things: `status` and `result`.
*   `result`: If successful, this variable holds our new panoramic image.
*   `status`: This is a special code, like a grade on a test. It tells us exactly what happened.

If we just assume it worked every time and try to save the `result`, our program might crash if the stitching failed and `result` is empty. We need a way to check the `status` grade *before* we proceed.

## The Solution: A Fork in the Road (`if/else`)

In programming, we use an `if/else` statement to make decisions. It's like coming to a fork in the road. You look at a sign (our `status` variable) and decide which path to take.

*   **`if`** the sign says "Success," you go down one path (save the panorama).
*   **`else`** (otherwise), you go down the other path (report an error).

This is one of the most fundamental concepts in all of programming. It allows our program to react differently to different situations.

### Checking the Status Code

The `status` variable holds a number. The [OpenCV (cv2) Module](09_opencv__cv2__module.md) gives us a special named value to check against: `cv2.Stitcher_OK`. Think of this as the code for "Everything went perfectly!"

So, our "sign" at the fork in the road is the question: "Does our `status` variable equal `cv2.Stitcher_OK`?"

Let's see how this looks in our `main.py` code.

```python
# We've just called the stitcher...
(status, result) = stitcher.stitch(images)

# Now we check the status code to make a decision.
# The '==' symbol means "is equal to".
if status == cv2.Stitcher_OK:
    # This block of code only runs if stitching was successful.
    print('Panorama Generated')
else:
    # This block of code only runs if stitching failed.
    print('Panorama Generation Unsuccessful')
```

This simple `if/else` structure is the heart of our program's logic. It allows us to handle both success and failure gracefully.

## The Two Paths: Success and Failure

Let's look at what happens on each path.

### Path 1: The "Success" Path

If `status` is `cv2.Stitcher_OK`, the code inside the `if` block is executed.

```python
if status == cv2.Stitcher_OK:
    print('Panorama Generated')

    # We'll learn about these steps in the next chapters!
    # 1. Save the result to a file
    # 2. Show the result on the screen
```
On this path, we know that the `result` variable contains a valid, beautiful panorama. We can now safely work with it, printing a success message and getting ready to save and display it.

### Path 2: The "Failure" Path

If the `status` is anything else (meaning, not `OK`), the code inside the `else` block is executed.

```python
else:
    # The stitching failed, so we just print a message.
    print('Panorama Generation Unsuccessful')
```
On this path, we know something went wrong. The `result` variable is likely empty or useless. We don't try to save or show it, which prevents our program from crashing. We simply inform the user that it didn't work for this set of images and the program moves on to the next folder.

## Visualizing the Decision

We can map out this logic with a simple flowchart. The program reaches a decision point and follows a different branch depending on the answer.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Call stitcher.stitch()] --> B{Was the status OK?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Success Path<br/>Print "Success"<br/>Save and Show Panorama];
    B -- No --> D[Failure Path<br/>Print "Unsuccessful"];
    C --> E[Move to next folder];
    D --> E;
```

This check makes our program **robust**. A robust program is one that can handle unexpected problems without breaking. By checking the status, we anticipate potential failures and tell our program how to deal with them gracefully.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned about a crucial programming concept: making decisions with `if/else` statements. We saw how to check the `status` code returned by the stitcher to determine if the [Panorama Generation](01_panorama_generation.md) was successful or not. This **Stitching Status Check** allows our program to follow different paths for success and failure, making it smarter and more reliable.

We now know *how* to confirm that we have a successful panorama. But what do we do with it? On the success path, our next job is to save this newly created image to our computer so we can use it later. That's exactly what we'll cover in the next chapter.
