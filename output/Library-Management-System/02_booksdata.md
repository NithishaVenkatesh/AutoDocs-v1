# Section 2: booksData

## Overview

`booksData` is a constant array that serves as the in-memory mock database for the application. It contains a collection of book objects, each with detailed properties. It is the primary data source for any component that needs to list, filter, or display book information, such as the `Books` and `Search` pages. The data is static and defined as a `const` assertion for type-level immutability.

## Public API

The `booksData` constant exports a read-only array of book objects. The type for a single book can be inferred.

### Types

**`Book`**

The type for a single book object can be derived from the `booksData` array:

```typescript
import { booksData } from './pages/Books';

type Book = typeof booksData[number];
```

**Object Structure**

Each `Book` object in the array conforms to the following structure:

| Property     | Type           | Description                                    |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | `number`       | Unique identifier for the book.                |
| `title`      | `string`       | The title of the book.                         |
| `author`     | `string`       | The author of the book.                        |
| `coverImage` | `string` (URL) | URL for the book's cover image.                |
| `rating`     | `number`       | The average user rating (out of 5).            |
| `price`      | `number`       | The price of the book in cents (e.g., 1499).   |
| `genre`      | `string`       | The genre of the book (e.g., "Fantasy").       |

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { booksData } from './pages/Books';

// Access the first book in the dataset
const firstBook = booksData[0];

console.log(firstBook.title); // "The Magic of Colors"
```

## How It Works

`booksData` is a compile-time constant defined and exported directly from `src/pages/Books.tsx`. It is not fetched from an external API or service. Components import this array directly and use standard JavaScript array methods (`.map`, `.filter`, `.find`) to process and display the data.

The `as const` assertion provides two key benefits:
1.  **Immutability**: TypeScript will raise an error if any code attempts to modify the array or its objects (e.g., using `push` or reassigning a property).
2.  **Type Narrowing**: Properties like `genre` are inferred as literal types (e.g., `"Fantasy"` | `"Adventure"`) rather than the general `string` type, enabling more precise type-checking.

## Integration Steps

To use `booksData` in a component, import it and use it directly within your component's logic.

1.  **Import `booksData`**:
    Add the import statement at the top of your component file.

    ```tsx
    import { booksData } from '../pages/Books';
    ```

2.  **Utilize in Component**:
    Map over the array to render elements or filter it based on component state.

    ```tsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { booksData } from '../pages/Books';

    const BookList = () => (
      <div>
        <h1>All Book Titles</h1>
        <ul>
          {booksData.map(book => (
            <li key={book.id}>{book.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
    ```

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

As `booksData` is a static, local constant, it is not subject to runtime errors like network failures, timeouts, or rate limits.

-   **Data Integrity**: Data is assumed to be valid and complete. In a production environment, this would be replaced by an API call with proper data validation and error handling for malformed responses.
-   **Empty Array**: If the `booksData` array were to be empty, components using it should conditionally render a "no results" or empty state message to avoid a blank UI.
-   **Immutability**: The `as const` assertion prevents accidental mutations at the type level. Runtime attempts to modify the array will fail if the code is running in strict mode.

## Examples

### Example 1: Rendering All Book Titles

A minimal React component that imports `booksData` and renders an unordered list of book titles.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { booksData } from './pages/Books';

const AllBookTitles = () => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {booksData.map(book => (
        <li key={book.id}>
          {book.title} by {book.author}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default AllBookTitles;
```

### Example 2: Finding a Book by ID

A utility function to retrieve a specific book from the dataset using its `id`.

```typescript
import { booksData } from './pages/Books';

type Book = typeof booksData[number];

function findBookById(id: number): Book | undefined {
  return booksData.find(book => book.id === id);
}

const book = findBookById(3);
console.log(book?.title); // "The Colorful Mystery"
```

## Related Components

-   [Books](05_books.md): The primary page component that displays and filters the entire book collection from `booksData`.
-   [Search](06_search.md): A component that likely uses `booksData` as its searchable dataset.
-   [BookCard](08_bookcard.md): The component used to display a single book's information, receiving its props from an object within `booksData`.

## File References

-   `src/pages/Books.tsx`: The file where `booksData` is defined and exported.
