# Tutorial: SpeakRAG

SpeakRAG is a beginner-friendly web application that acts as a smart document assistant.
You can upload a *PDF document*, and the app will process and understand its content using a process called **vectorization**. Then, you can ask questions about the document using your *voice*. The app *transcribes* your speech to text, finds the most relevant information in the PDF, and uses a powerful **Large Language Model (LLM)** to generate a spoken answer.
