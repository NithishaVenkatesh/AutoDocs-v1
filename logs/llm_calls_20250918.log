You are analyzing the `AutoDocs` project. Below is a list of files:

- 0 # README.md

And here is the code content:

--- File Index 0: README.md ---
# AutoDocs



Identify up to 10 key abstractions (classes, functions, components, or modules).
For each abstraction, provide:
- name (string, english if specified)
- description (string, english if specified)
- file_indices (list of integers corresponding to the file indices above)

Format the output in YAML:

```yaml
- name: AbstractionName
  description: Explanation here
  file_indices: [0, 2]
- name: AnotherThing
  description: Another explanation
  file_indices: [1]

Please provide:
1. A high-level `summary` of the project's main purpose and functionality in a few beginner-friendly sentences. Use markdown formatting with **bold** and *italic* text to highlight important concepts.
2. A list (`relationships`) describing the key interactions between these abstractions. For each relationship, specify:
    - `from_abstraction`: Index of the source abstraction (e.g., `0 # AbstractionName1`)
    - `to_abstraction`: Index of the target abstraction (e.g., `1 # AbstractionName2`)
    - `label`: A brief label for the interaction **in just a few words** (e.g., "Manages", "Inherits", "Uses").
    Ideally the relationship should be backed by one abstraction calling or passing parameters to another.
    Simplify the relationship and exclude those non-important ones.

IMPORTANT: Make sure EVERY abstraction is involved in at least ONE relationship (either as source or target). Each abstraction index must appear at least once across all relationships.

Format the output as YAML:

```yaml
summary: |
  A brief, simple explanation of the project.
  Can span multiple lines with **bold** and *italic* for emphasis.
relationships:
  - from_abstraction: 0 # AbstractionName1
    to_abstraction: 1 # AbstractionName2
    label: "Manages"
  - from_abstraction: 2 # AbstractionName3
    to_abstraction: 0 # AbstractionName1
    label: "Provides config"
  # ... other relationships

Write a very beginner-friendly tutorial chapter (in Markdown format) for the project `AutoDocs` about the concept: "AutoDocs". This is Chapter 1.

Concept Details:
- Name: AutoDocs
- Description:
The main project or application, named "AutoDocs". Based on the name, it is likely intended to be a tool or system for generating documentation automatically. The README.md file serves as the primary entry point for understanding the project's identity.

Complete Tutorial Structure:
1. [AutoDocs](01_autodocs.md)

Context from previous chapters:
This is the first chapter.

Relevant Code Snippets (Code itself remains unchanged):
--- File: README.md ---
# AutoDocs

Instructions for the chapter (Generate content in English unless specified otherwise):
- Start with a clear heading (e.g., `# Chapter 1: AutoDocs`). Use the provided concept name.

- If this is not the first chapter, begin with a brief transition from the previous chapter, referencing it with a proper Markdown link using its name.

- Begin with a high-level motivation explaining what problem this abstraction solves. Start with a central use case as a concrete example. The whole chapter should guide the reader to understand how to solve this use case. Make it very minimal and friendly to beginners.

- If the abstraction is complex, break it down into key concepts. Explain each concept one-by-one in a very beginner-friendly way.

- Explain how to use this abstraction to solve the use case. Give example inputs and outputs for code snippets (if the output isn't values, describe at a high level what will happen).

- Each code block should be BELOW 10 lines! If longer code blocks are needed, break them down into smaller pieces and walk through them one-by-one. Aggresively simplify the code to make it minimal. Use comments to skip non-important implementation details. Each code block should have a beginner friendly explanation right after it.

- Describe the internal implementation to help understand what's under the hood. First provide a non-code or code-light walkthrough on what happens step-by-step when the abstraction is called. It's recommended to use a simple sequenceDiagram with a dummy example - keep it minimal with at most 5 participants to ensure clarity. If participant name has space, use: `participant QP as Query Processing`. .

- Then dive deeper into code for the internal implementation with references to files. Provide example code blocks, but make them similarly simple and beginner-friendly. Explain.

- IMPORTANT: When you need to refer to other core abstractions covered in other chapters, ALWAYS use proper Markdown links like this: [Chapter Title](filename.md). Use the Complete Tutorial Structure above to find the correct filename and the chapter title. Translate the surrounding text.

- Use mermaid diagrams to illustrate complex concepts (```mermaid``` format). .

- Heavily use analogies and examples throughout to help beginners understand.

- End the chapter with a brief conclusion that summarizes what was learned and provides a transition to the next chapter. If there is a next chapter, use a proper Markdown link: [Next Chapter Title](next_chapter_filename).

- Ensure the tone is welcoming and easy for a newcomer to understand.

- Output *only* the Markdown content for this chapter.

Now, directly provide a super beginner-friendly Markdown output (DON'T need ```markdown``` tags):

Welcome to the world of AutoDocs! If you've ever felt that writing documentation is a chore that takes you away from the fun of coding, then you're in the right place. Let's dive into what AutoDocs is and how it can become your new best friend.

### The Problem: The Documentation Nightmare

Imagine you've just built an amazing new feature. It's a small function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart. It works perfectly!

Now comes the not-so-fun part: you need to explain how to use it. You have to write down what the function does, what inputs it needs (like a list of items), and what it gives back (the final price).

A week later, you update the function to also handle discount codes. Uh-oh! Now you have to remember to go back and update the documentation. If you forget, the documentation becomes outdated and misleading, which is often worse than no documentation at all!

This is a common headache for developers. We love to build, but keeping documentation in sync with our code can be a real struggle.

### The Solution: Meet AutoDocs!

This is the exact problem `AutoDocs` was created to solve.

**`AutoDocs` is a tool that automatically generates documentation directly from your code.**

Think of it like a smart scribe for your project. You focus on writing great code, and `AutoDocs` reads over your shoulder, understands what you've built, and writes clear, accurate documentation for you. When your code changes, you simply run `AutoDocs` again, and your documentation is instantly updated. No more manual updates, no more outdated guides!

### How Does It Work?

At its heart, `AutoDocs` is a "code-to-document" generator. Its main job is to read your project's files and produce human-readable documentation, like the `README.md` file that you often see in projects.

Let's look at the "face" of our own project, the `README.md` file.

---
**File: `README.md`**
```markdown
# AutoDocs
```
---

This simple file gives our project its identity. `AutoDocs` helps create and maintain files like this, along with more detailed documentation, by pulling information directly from the source. It ensures the documentation lives alongside the code it describes, making it easier to keep everything synchronized.

### Under the Hood: A Quick Tour

So, what happens when you tell `AutoDocs` to work its magic? Let's follow the journey from a command in your terminal to a beautiful documentation file.

#### The Step-by-Step Process

Imagine you have a project and you run the `autodocs` command. Here’s a simplified view of what goes on behind the scenes:

1.  **Scan:** `AutoDocs` starts by scanning the folders and files in your project.
2.  **Parse:** It reads your source code files, looking for key pieces of information—like functions, classes, and special comments you've written.
3.  **Collect:** It gathers all this information into a structured format, like a blueprint of your project's components.
4.  **Generate:** Finally, it takes this structured information and uses a template to generate the final documentation files, such as Markdown (`.md`) files.

This process can be visualized with a simple diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AutoDocs
    participant Code Parser
    participant Doc Generator

    User->>AutoDocs: Run command to generate docs
    AutoDocs->>Code Parser: Scan project files
    Code Parser-->>AutoDocs: Return structured data
    AutoDocs->>Doc Generator: Use data to build docs
    Doc Generator-->>AutoDocs: Return final documentation
    AutoDocs-->>User: Docs are ready!
```

This diagram shows how the `User` interacts with `AutoDocs`, which then uses its internal parts (the `Code Parser` and `Doc Generator`) to get the job done. It’s a simple but powerful workflow!

### Conclusion

You now have a high-level understanding of what **AutoDocs** is: a powerful tool designed to automate the creation and maintenance of documentation. It bridges the gap between your code and its explanation, saving you time and ensuring your documentation is always accurate.

By taking on the tedious task of documentation, `AutoDocs` frees you up to focus on what you do best: writing amazing code. In the chapters to come, we will explore the different pieces of `AutoDocs` that work together to make this magic happen.
